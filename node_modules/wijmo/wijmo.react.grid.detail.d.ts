/**
 * React component for the {@link wijmo.grid.detail.FlexGridDetailProvider} class.
 *
 * The <b>flex-grid-detail</b> component should be contained in
 * a {@link wijmo.react.grid.FlexGrid} component.
 *
 * The component supports all properties and events of the pure JavaScript {@link wijmo.grid.detail.FlexGridDetailProvider} class it represents.
 *
 * The component includes an <b>initialized</b> event that is raised when the control is initialized after it is added to the page.
 * You can use this event to perform further initialization in addition to setting properties in JSX.
 * The signature of the handler function is the same as any other Wijmo event handlers.
 *
 * The component includes a <b>template</b> property which is used to define template for detail row.
 * The template is a function with single argument. The argument is a plain object with keys of
 * <b>row</b> (the row to which detail row belongs),
 * <b>item</b> (item data related to the row) and
 * <b>provider</b> (FlexGrid control, owner of the row).
