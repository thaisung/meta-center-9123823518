    <ol type="a">
      <li>
        <strong>Developer License</strong>. Subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA, You are granted a royalty-free license to use the SOFTWARE to develop and distribute applications for a perpetual term.

There is no limit or restriction on the number of installations of the SOFTWARE, which may be on different machines; provided, however, that the SOFTWARE may not be used by anyone other than You as a single Developer.  By way of example, if a company has five developers using the Software, the company needs to purchase five licenses, irrespective of how the Software is accessed or how many installations are accessed.
        <br>
        License to Distribute. You are licensed to distribute the SOFTWARE as an incorporated part of your Applications on a royalty-free basis.
